# [WIP] Swift Shop

A quick & easy shopping list experience for iOS.

## Using Swift Shop

- Add products to your "repository" using the products tab
- Tag each product with information you'd find useful, or would like to search by
  - e.g. Carrots might have the tags `Grocery Store`, `Vegetables`, `Aisle 3`, while beer may have the tags `Liquor Store`, `Beverage`, etc
- When you're planning to visit a store, filter the products tab by relevant tags, and tap items to add them to your list
- View the list tab to see your added items, and tap to check each one off as you shop
  - If you've filled out the price field on each item, you'll see a total cost of items you've checked off so far
